Hello there.
This is a project given to us by our C.S. teacher for our session ending projects.

We decided that we will make our own scientific calculator.
However, by no means is this scientific at all.

The key distinction for this project is its modularity.
Instead of everything being in one single Python program file, there are 3 custom modules.

If a user wishes to, they can access any one of the module indivudally. 
However, the Scientific Calculator program allows the user to switch between any of the three modules seamlessly, without having to change through multiple files.

One program to access any of the three programs.

Hehe :D

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    You can download the zip file and get all four programs neatly packed in one folder. 
    If you wish to see the source code without downloading the program, then you can access them by clicking on any of the program files ending with the Python extension .py
    Obviously, if you are a madman and decide to download every file individually, then do remember to keep all of them in the same folder on your PC.
    If you do not do so, the Scientific Calculator will not be able to access any of the custom modules.



Hope you enjoy it.
